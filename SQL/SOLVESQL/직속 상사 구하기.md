```sql
SELECT employees.employee_id as employee_id
  , employees.name as name
  ,manager.employee_id as manager_id
  , manager.name as manager_name
FROM employees
  LEFT JOIN employees AS manager on employees.manager_id = manager.employee_id
WHERE manager.employee_id <> ""
ORDER BY employees.employee_id
```

 *mSELF INNER JOIN 할 때 자기 TABLE JOIN 하면 되긴 하는데, ‘ALIAS’를 따로 붙여줘야한다는 점 기억하기!**
